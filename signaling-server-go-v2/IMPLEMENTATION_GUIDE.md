# WebRTC Signaling Server Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide describes how to extend the signaling server foundation to create a fully functional WebRTC signaling server. The current codebase provides a robust infrastructure with all the necessary components for a production-grade service, but specific WebRTC signaling logic needs to be implemented.

## Signaling Protocol

A basic signaling protocol implementation is provided in `internal/api/websocket/protocol/signaling.go`. This protocol:

1. Allows clients to join and leave rooms
2. Facilitates relaying of WebRTC signaling messages (offers, answers, and ICE candidates) between peers
3. Provides room management functionality

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Dependencies

First, resolve all dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Integrate Signaling Protocol with WebSocket Handler

Update the WebSocket handler to use the signaling protocol. Modify `internal/api/websocket/gorilla/handler.go` to:

- Create a SignalingManager instance
- Forward incoming messages to the SignalingManager
- Implement room-based message broadcasting

### 3. Add Authentication (Optional)

Implement authentication middleware to secure the WebSocket endpoint:

- Add JWT validation in a new middleware component
- Include user/client identification in the WebSocket connection
- Apply authentication checks before allowing signaling operations

### 4. Add Rate Limiting and Security Measures

Enhance security by implementing:

- Rate limiting for connections and messages
- Input validation for all message types
- Connection timeout handling
- Message size restrictions

### 5. Extend Monitoring

Add signaling-specific metrics:

- Track room counts and sizes
- Measure message types and frequencies
- Monitor connection durations
- Record peer-to-peer connection success rates

### 6. Implement Persistence (Optional)

Add persistence for rooms and sessions:

- Implement a storage interface in `internal/storage`
- Create adapters for different backends (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Add session recovery mechanisms for reconnections

### 7. Scale with Redis Pub/Sub (Optional)

For horizontal scaling:

- Implement a Redis Pub/Sub adapter for message distribution
- Create a cluster-aware room manager
- Modify the WebSocket handler to use distributed messaging

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing

A simple way to test the server is using `wscat` to connect as multiple clients:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Client 1
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/ws
# Join a room
{"type":"join","room":"test-room","sender":"client1"}

# Terminal 2 - Client 2
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/ws
# Join the same room
{"type":"join","room":"test-room","sender":"client2"}
# Send an offer to Client 1
{"type":"offer","room":"test-room","sender":"client2","recipient":"client1","payload":{"sdp":"example SDP data"}}
```

### Automated Testing

Implement comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for the signaling protocol
- Integration tests for the WebSocket handling
- Load tests to verify scalability

## Deployment

The server is ready for containerized deployment with Docker and includes Kubernetes-compatible health checks.

For production deployment:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   make docker-build
   ```

2. Deploy to Kubernetes using the provided readiness/liveness probes

3. Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

4. Configure distributed tracing with Jaeger or another OpenTelemetry backend
